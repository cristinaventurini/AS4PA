Assignments and final project for the course of *Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis* by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini, first year master course in Physics of Data, Padua.

***Assignments*** <br>
Collection of assignments undertaken during the course *Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis* by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini during the first year of my master course in Physics of Data. <br>
The programming language is R and the topics range from basic probability concepts (Bayes theorem, discrete and continuous probabilty distributions) to more advanced ones such as Bayesian inference and Hypothesis testing. 

The topics in detail: 

1 - R basics <br>
2 - Probability distributions 1 <br>
3 - Probability distributions 2 <br>
4 - Six boxes toy model <br>
5 - Bayesian inference 1 <br>
6 - Bayesian inference 2 <br>
7 - Hypothesis testing <br>

***Final project*** <br>
As a final project for this course I developed, together with two colleagues, an implementation of the K2 algorithm, a score-based algorithm in Bayesian network.
