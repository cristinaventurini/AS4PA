Assignments and final project for the course of Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis

**Assignements**
Collection of assignements undertaken during the course *Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis* by Prof. Alberto Garfagnini during the first year of my master course in Physics of Data. <br>
The programming language is R and the topics range from basic probability concepts (Bayes theorem, discrete and continuous probabilty distributions) to more advanced ones such as Bayesian inference and Hypothesis testing. 

The topics in detail: 

1 - R basics
2 - Probability distributions 1
3 - Probability distributions 2
4 - Six boxes toy model
5 - Bayesian inference 1
6 - Bayesian inference 2
7 - Hypothesis testing

**Final project**
As a final project for this course I developed, together with two colleagues, an implementation of the K2 algorithm, a score-based algorithm in Bayesian network.
